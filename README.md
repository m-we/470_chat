Users can create and run their own chat server, or join an existing one. Each server is hosted in AWS cloud. Unfortunately, I was not able to work out a bug which required me to manually upload and run the chat server code to each EC2 instance. Therefore to start a chat server requires some manual work (and your own EC2 account and credentials, since I shut everything down), however once it is running you can chat over Amazon's servers and other users can join.
